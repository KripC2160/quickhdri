# quickhdri
Blender addon that allows you to quickly add HDRIs from [Polyhaven.com](https://polyhaven.com/).
#### Currently 16K, 20K, and 24K aren't supported as each HDRIs have different filetype, or number of resolution it supports 
--- 

How to use the addon: 

- 1: add the link of the polyhaven hdri you want to use in the text bar 
- 2: select the resolution and the file type of the hdri 
- 3: import it 

## TODO
- [ x ] Add Windows support 
- [ ] Add result message
- [ ] Add 16k, 20k, and 24k resolution support
- [ ] Save the HDRI locally in blend file and delete ne in downloads directory
